I am a student of BITS-Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus. 
I would like to talk about a possible association between Bausch + Lomb and our annual cultural fest - Waves. 

Waves is one of the largest cultural fests in India that attracts more than 6000 participants in attendance.
This fest would take place in late October to Early November in a normal year.
As of now it is going to take place online.

 We would be glad to form an association with you so as to sponsor the fest.
It would be great if you could provide me with your contact details so that we can take the talks further.

Thanking You,
Ananth Raghav
